# WilloRHI
It's just another Vulkan wrapper, nothing special going on here
I'm mainly doing this to try elevate my knowledge of Vulkan and general graphics programming concepts.

This is effectively abandoned for now - vaporware, if you like. I've decided to work on other equally cool things.
I may come back if I get the urge to work on this.

## Building
You will need to have the Vulkan SDK and CMake installed, every other dependency will be downloaded automagically.
```
git clone https://github.com/Willoguns01/WilloRHI.git
cd WilloRHI
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
