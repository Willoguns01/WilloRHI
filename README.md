# WilloRHI
It's just another Vulkan wrapper, nothing special going on here

## Building
You will need to have the Vulkan SDK and CMake installed, every other dependency will be installed automagically.
```
git clone https://github.com/Willoguns01/WilloRHI.git
cd WilloRHI
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
